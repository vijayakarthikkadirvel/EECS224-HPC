Mandelbrot implementation using MPI

Mandelbrot is a classical problem which requires communication between multiple pixels. For this problem, I used MPI as my parallel 
execution model.  

To run it:
1.) make 
2.) run the script in HPC cluster 
3.) Check the results after the execution is over in the HPC cluster.
